# How to compile, install dependencies, and run your project

## Basin Hopping
- only Numpy needed as a dependency, sufficient to run and compile code

## Miller-Rabin
- Python libraries: `.time`, `.random`, `Statistics`, `.math`

## Freivald's Algorithm
- requires Numpy and `.time` (both basic Python libraries)

## SPSA
- Standard Python libraries: `.time`, `.random`, `.numpy`, `.matplotlib`

## Randomised Quicksort
- Only Numpy necessary

## Randomised Routing
- Put both programs (`analysis_graphs.py` and `randomised_routing.py`) in the same directory
- `import random`, `import collections`
- Other core libraries: Numpy, `.matplotlib`

## Football League Simulator (Monte Carlo)
- `from simulation import montesimulations`
- `glob` used for file-based searching
- `streamlit` is python framework for building interactive web apps
- make sure all three files - `app.py`, `data_loader.py` and `simulation.py` are in the same directory before running
- To run: `streamlit run app.py` from inside the Football-Season-Predictor directory
