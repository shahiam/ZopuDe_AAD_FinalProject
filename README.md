how to compile, install dependencies, and run your project

Basin Hopping: \n
  only Numpy needed as a dependency, sufficient to run and compile code \n
Miller-Rabin: \n
  Python libraries: .time, .random, Statistics, .math \n
Freivald's Algorithm: \n
  requires Numpy and .time (both basic Python libraries) \n
SPSA: \n
  Standard Python libraries: .time, .random, .numpy, .matplotlib \n
Randomised Quicksort: \n
  Only Numpy necessary \n
Randomised Routing: \n
  Put both programs (analysis_graphs.py and randomised_routing.py) in the same directory \n
  import random, import collections \n
  Other core libraries: Numpy, .matplotlib \n
Football League Simulator (Monte Carlo): \n
  from simulation import montesimulations \n
  glob used for file-based searching \n
  streamlit is python framework for building interactive web apps \n
  make sure all three files - app.py, data_loader.py and simulation.py are in the same directory before running \n
