how to compile, install dependencies, and run your project

Basin Hopping: 
  only Numpy needed as a dependency, sufficient to run and compile code
Miller-Rabin:
  Python libraries: .time, .random, Statistics, .math
Freivald's Algorithm:
  requires Numpy and .time (both basic Python libraries) 
SPSA:
  Standard Python libraries: .time, .random, .numpy, .matplotlib
Randomised Quicksort:
  Only Numpy necessary
Randomised Routing:
  Put both programs (analysis_graphs.py and randomised_routing.py) in the same directory
  import random, import collections
  Other core libraries: Numpy, .matplotlib
Football League Simulator (Monte Carlo):
  from simulation import montesimulations
